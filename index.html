						<h3>Project : Painter By Numbers</h3>
						<p>This project is a Deep learning project, the primary goal of our project, is developing a model capable of determining whether two given images belong to the same artist or not.</p>
						<p>In this project My teammate and I leveraged the power of neural networks  and more specifically the power of siamese networks.</p>
                        <p>With an original Picasso carrying a 106 million dollar price tag, identifying an authentic work of art from a forgery is a high-stakes industry. While algorithms have gotten good at telling at classification of items, they aren't yet able to tell us with certainty if both paintings are by van Gogh.  </p>
                        <p>and this is why we choose this project, to explore this new and exciting part of deep learning!</p>

						<h3>Project : Machine Learning Project</h3>
						<p>I am actively engaged in the development of a personal machine learning-driven Value trading project. This initiative centers on identifying undervalued stocks companies on the stock market, providing valuable insights into the company’s future.</p>
						<p>This undertaking not only showcases my technical proficiency in machine learning but also underscores my commitment to independently learn new subjects as I’ve accumulated a lot of information about the stock market, financial reports, web scraping, how to leverage technology for strategic financial analysis and how to use python to its fullest ability.</p>

						<h3>Project : Software Engineering project</h3>
						<p>Played a key role in developing a cutting-edge High School Test System in a team environment, integrating JavaFX technologies. Leveraged a seamless client-server architecture and SQL database management.</p>
                        <p>Our system catered to the needs of modern high schools, enabling teachers to effortlessly generate exam questions and create comprehensive assessments. Thanks to its sophisticated capabilities, the system not only facilitated exam creation but also efficiently auto checked and graded exams, providing teachers with valuable statistical insights into their students' performance, also students were granted seamless access to log in, solve exams in real-time, and view their grades, promoting a productive and engaging learning experience.</p>

						<h3>Project : Photo - mosaic</h3>
                        <p> a fun personal python mini-project that given an image and  a group of secondary images, it creates a Mosaic of the main image with each mosaic tile being an image from the secondary images.</p>
                        <p>I had the idea for this project independently a long time ago, after learning image processing, applied my knowledge creatively to bring my idea to life.</p>
